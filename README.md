# Rough

Rough is RPC for Ruby on Rails.

## Usage

Using `Rough` is very simple.  All you need to do is add `rpc` to
`config/routes.rb` like so:

``` ruby
get '/something' => 'something#index', rpc: 'Something::SomethingService#list'
```

and have `ApplicationController` (or a subset of your controllers) include
`Rough::BaseController`.

In your controllers, you'll then have access to the request and response protos,
and they'll automatically be serialized/de-serialized to JSON or RPC, keeping
things nice and consistent:

``` ruby
class Something
  def index
    response_proto.name = [request_proto.first_name, request_proto.last_name].join(' ')
  end
end
```

## What happens

By doing that, your routes will be accessible over RPC, and also via traditional
HTTP (as defined in the normal routes syntax).

HTTP:

```
GET /something?param=one
RESPONSE JSON: { "some": "output" }
```

RPC via connector:

```
POST /services/something.SomethingService/List
REQUEST PROTO: SomethingRequest.new(param: 'one')
RESPONSE PROTO: SomethingResponse.new(some: 'output')
```

## Warming Cache

Some applications may choose to warm the route cache on startup.  To do so:

``` ruby
Rough::RouteRegistry.warm!
```

## Running Specs

`rake`

## Releasing

`rake release`

This will run the tests, build the gem, tag and release the current code,
at the version specified in `Rough::VERSION`.
